First post! It only took a few minutes to set up this Jekyll blog thanks to Barry Clark's repo (detailed article <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages">here</a>). My plan is to post on tech topics that I find interesting, and tips and tricks I stumble upon while learning!

**Public Domain Digital Images from NYPL**

The <a href="https://www.nypl.org">New York Public Library</a> recently released 180,000+ hi-res images that are public domain, copyright-free so you can download and use them freely in personal and commerical projects. I had no idea that libraries were digitizing and providing so much reference material for the general public! There is a division called NYPL Labs that is making this data available in innovative ways - this <a href="http://publicdomain.nypl.org/pd-visualization/">data visualization</a> of all the 180k images is. so. good.

You can apply for a (remote or in-person) <a href="http://www.nypl.org/help/about-nypl/fellowships-institutes/remix">NYPL Labs fellowship</a> to do something creative with the public domain materials. I plan to apply but need to think of an idea before the Feb 19 due date! I'm considering using some of their costume (<a href="http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/history-of-the-feminine-costume-of-the-world-from-the-year-5318-bc#/?tab=about&scroll=18">1</a>, <a href="http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/imported-french-fabrics-e-meyer-co-paris-fall-1930-1931#/?tab=about">2</a>) or botanical (<a href="http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/trait-des-arbres-et-arbustes-que-lon-cultive-en-france-en-pleine-terre#/?tab=about&scroll=86">1</a>, <a href="http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/84fe2cd0-c6e4-012f-1676-3c075448cc4b#/?tab=about">2</a>) collections. They have an API with well-explained documentation for developers.


**References for Copyright Free Images** 

- <a href="http://www.nypl.org/research/collections/digital-collections/public-domain">NYPL public domain</a> (aka what this post has been about...)

- <a href="http://dp.la">Digital Public Library</a> has library, museum, archive materials from around the world

- <a href="https://www.unsplash.com">Unsplash.com</a> is a website with copyright-free hi-res images that are submitted by contributors. These are amazing, professional photographs. It is surprising (in a good way) that people would submit such high quality photographs to the public domain. The top photo is from Unsplash by Aaron Burden. Since it is copyright-free you don't have to credit the source, but it is a nice gesture.

- Many museums have wonderful collections of images that are *free for personal* use, but *not commercial* use. Be sure to check out the terms and conditions.
